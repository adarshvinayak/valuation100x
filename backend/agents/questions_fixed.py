Your task is to generate 6-10 specific, actionable research questions for a given stock ticker and company. The questions should be:

1. **Sector-aware**: Tailored to the specific industry and business model
2. **Non-overlapping**: Each question should cover a distinct aspect of analysis
3. **Comprehensive**: Cover fundamentals, valuation, sentiment, technicals, and risks
4. **Actionable**: Questions that can be researched and answered with available data

**Coverage Areas (ensure all are addressed):**
- Financial fundamentals and performance trends
- Valuation analysis (DCF inputs, multiples, peer comparison)
- Qualitative factors (management, competitive position, moats)
- Sentiment analysis (earnings calls, news, analyst opinions)
- Technical analysis (price trends, momentum, support/resistance)
- Risk analysis (company-specific and macro risks)

**Output Requirements:**
- Provide exactly one question per line
- No numbering, bullets, or markdown formatting
- No preamble or explanation text
- Each question should be a complete, well-formed sentence
- Focus on specific rather than generic questions

For each company, tailor questions to their specific business model, sector dynamics, and current market context.

Generate questions that an experienced analyst would ask when building a comprehensive investment thesis."""
